This Blender addon, "Batch Collection Link Injector," is designed to streamline the process of linking collections from a source `.blend` file into multiple target `.blend` files. It's particularly useful for projects where you need to inject a set of standard collections (like characters, props, or environments) into many different scene files, especially when dealing with a large number of files or a complex directory structure.

> **Note:** This is a beta version. Please back up your files before using this addon, as unforeseen issues could potentially lead to data loss.

### 4. Find Matches

2.  Click the "Find Matches" button.
3.  The "Matches" list will show the collections from the source file and the subdirectory they have been matched with.
4.  You can manually check or uncheck the boxes to control which collections get injected into which subdirectories.
5.  You can use the "Select All Matches" and "Clear All Matches" buttons to quickly select or deselect all matches.
6.  Enable "Use Regex Matching" for more advanced matching using regular expressions.

## üß™ Dry Run Mode

Before committing to the injection, you can perform a "Dry Run." This will simulate the injection process and show you what actions would be taken without actually modifying any files.

1.  Enable the "Dry Run" checkbox in the "Inject Collections" section.
2.  Click the "Inject Collections" button.
3.  The log will show which collections would be injected into which files.

## üìù Logging

The "Log" panel in the "Inject Collections" section provides detailed information about the injection process. It will show you which files are being processed, which collections are being linked, and any errors that may have occurred. This is useful for troubleshooting and verifying that the process completed successfully.
